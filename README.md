# Sparsy

Hey I though we needed sparse matrices !?
We don't use it here but someday we might have to so let's keep the name that way.

- To install the tools simply `git clone https://github.com/monkeyusage/sparsy` then `git pull` and finally run : `python install.py` into your terminal
- Modify the config file: `data/config.json` to your convenience
- To launch the script use : `run.bat`

Before you run the project please pay attention to the configuration file in the data folder

Mention the file names in their dedicated sections. This software takes in dta files and outputs a dta file.

If you want to process the whole data in one pass simply insert a negative number in the iteration_size configuation. Iteration_size corresponds to the number of years to include each iteration.
