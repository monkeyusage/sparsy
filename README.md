# Sparsy

Hey I though we needed sparse matrices !?
We don't use it here but someday we might have to so let's keep the name that way.

- To install the tools simply run : `python install.py` into your terminal
- To launch the script use : `run.bat`

Before you run the project please pay attention to the configuration file in the data folder

Mention the file names in their dedicated sections. For convenience this software takes in tsv files and outputs tsv files.

If you want to process the whole data in one pass simply insert a negative number in the iteration_size configuation.
